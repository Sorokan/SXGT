STRUCTURE
---------

sxgt-core/             -- the core module that can be used without 
                          changes in every project
                       
sxgt-examples-api/     -- an example for a custom spring tag lib schema
                          and a set of groovy templates that 
                          expands those tags into ordinary spring xml.
                          For every project this has to be defined
                          just once 

sxgt-examples-use/     -- an example application that shows how to
                          use the custom spring tag lib schema to
                          reduce the amount of xml configuration

For building the modules, you need maven2 (http://maven.apache.org/)
